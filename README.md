# CMLS-Homework-3-Group-8

Our task for this homework was to create a Drum Set using SuperCollider and an interface to control the parameters of such a Drum Set.

A total of 5 different drum sounds are synthesised, along with a User Interface to control them using different input devices.
In this report, we are going to explain the generation of the drum sounds, the interactive system design and the protocol communication between different interfaces.

We implemented our project using SuperCollider, an environment and programming language for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition, and Arduino, a microcontroller designed to interact with the incoming real-world data through an electronic prototyping platform.
