Create a set of drum sounds (min 3) and an interface to control them.
For the synthesis part (e.g., subtractive synthesis), use SuperCollider. Feel free to check the examples on https://sccode.org and other resources online. You can implement even non-traditional drum sounds if you want (e.g., not just percussive ones).

As far as the interaction part is concerned (e.g., synthesis parameters setting, play the drum, etc.), you can exploit either MIDI or OSC communication protocols. For example, you can use touchOSC app (https://hexler.net/products/touchosc). Alternatively, you can combine Processing, JUCE to turn other devices (e.g., Arduino, Kinect, etc.) into input peripherals.

Be creative, feel free to combine different components for visualization, user interaction and control.
